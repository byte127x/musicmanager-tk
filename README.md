# MusicManager - *Tk*
A Music Manager/Player built entirely in CustomTkinter

Unlike most tkinter music players, this app seeks to also catalog your music apps, and play a wide variety of music formats (achieved using libvlc)

## How to run
🪟 If you're on windows, just go to the "Releases" tab and download the "Windows.x64.zip" file. Then extract that and run "MusicManager.exe"
🍎/🐧 If you're on a Mac or GNU/Linux machine, or just want to use the source code, refer to the Setup Configuration below

## Setup Configuration
If you are on windows, you will need to copy the VLC files to the `lib/libvlc` folder
Otherwise, you will need to install VLC, and possibly replace the `CTkTitleMenu`, as it is not cross-platform

## Bugs and Unimplemented Features
If you see a bug, or want to implement a feature, then consider messaging me on Discord (DM `gl32`), or by making a new Issue in the Issues tab.
